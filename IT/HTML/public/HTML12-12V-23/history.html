      <h1>History of cryptocurrencies</h1>

      <p>
        In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous
        cryptographic electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he
        implemented it through Digicash, an early form of cryptographic
        electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw
        notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be
        sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable
        by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to
        Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a
        Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list and
        later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).

        In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as
        an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter,
        Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
        that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later
        gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency
        system which required users to complete a proof of work function with
        solutions being cryptographically put together and published.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by
        presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a
        cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011,
        Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which
        would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October
        2011, Litecoin was released. It used scrypt as its hash function instead
        of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin used a
        proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.

        On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned a
        study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the
        UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be
        considered.
