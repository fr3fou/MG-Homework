      <h1>What is a cryptocurrency?</h1>
      A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency or crypto for short) is a digital
      asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin
      ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of
      computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction
      records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the
      transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form
      (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.
      Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to
      centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a
      cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a
      single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented
      with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed
      ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public
      financial transaction database.
